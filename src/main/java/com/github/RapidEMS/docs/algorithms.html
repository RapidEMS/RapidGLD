	<p>As the behaviour of traffic light controllers and road users is best when insight of these agents in the
	infrastructure is greatest, and we cannot pre-set them to all possible road combinations,
	we enable learning in our algorithms. Reinforcement learning is used by both types of agents to minimise
	either the own waiting time or to keep the average waiting time over all road users minimal. </p>
	
	<p>But non-learning algorithms are also available, to make comparisons possible. The only omission in
	the traffic light control algorithms is a fixed algorithm, which is the common method of regulating
	traffic with traffic lights. It is pre-set for each real-life infrastructure, and therefore a user would have to
	set it up by hand, a time consuming affair, even more because simulation is only really usefull for
	large infrastructures, and requires trying out various settings. </p>
	<p>The variables in GLD consist of the road users and the way groups of traffic lights behave.
	Driving policies and traffic light controllers describe the algorithms used to coordinate
	the behaviour of these. Getting to know them will give more meaning to the evaluation of data from GLD.
	It isn't necessary to fully understand the way the variables for spawning and such affect
	the flow of traffic. Rather, it is worth knowing what kind of road network needs
	what kind of sophistication in its traffic light controller to sustain a certain density of traffic.</p>

	<P>
	Eventually, implementation of physical sensors in real-world road infrastructure will be expensive, so
	deciding which controller to implement is a matter of balancing its effectiveness on traffic and its cost.

	In the <A HREF="example.html">examples</A> the maps Simple and Complex are shown, which have been used
	in the here following subsections to give an idea of the performance of algorithms.
