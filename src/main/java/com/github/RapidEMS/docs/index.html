      <H2> Welcome to the Green Light District! </H2>

      <P> Congratulations with acquiring Green Light District, the Traffic & Traffic 
        Light Simulation & Evaluation Tool. With this documentation it will only 
        be a short while before you can create complex city maps, populate them 
        with various road users, and explore in depth the relations between 
        traffic control and commuters. You can jump right into the program, 
        letting the intuitive interface guide you from Editor to Simulator, try 
        out one of the standard maps, or follow the step-by-step examples, acquiring 
        the knowledge about Green Light District you need to use it to its maximum 
        potential. </P>

      <P> We present you with a tool with which extensive evaluation of various 
	city layouts and control configurations are possible with minimum user 
	input, and which may grow even more powerful. For Green Light District 
	is open source, giving you a tool for the future, that is able to keep
	up with advances in traffic technology such as GPS tracking and
	in-asphalt sensors the successful implementation of which
	it helps envision. </P>

	
	<br><H2> The Goal of the Green Light District Project </H2>

      <P>You probably are held up by a traffic light once in a while. Annoying, not?       
	 Ever wondered whether their controlling mechanisms could not better suit the flow of traffic?</P>
	<P>New advances in physical detection of passing road users and improved
	traffic light control algorithms are to be combined to optimize traffic
	flow in the future. Deciding the best use of these new technologies is
	best done by detailed simulation, to find out whether a costly new system
	would be profitable when applied to a certain infrastructure - this is the purpose of Green Light District.</P>
	<P>All facets of the problem are dealt with: map creation, experimenting
	with various traffic densities and control algorithms, and statistical analysis.
	Moreover, the program is open for future improvement because of its open source nature.</P>

	<p>Terms that require further description are explained in the <a href="definitions.html">Definitions</a> section.
	It is useful to browse the definitions, because simulated entities have a slightly different representation
	than in reality, and understanding them is paramount to profiting from Green Light District.
	If you plan to begin simulating right away, it is still wise to check the <a href="algorithms.html">Algorithms</a>
	section for insight in the heart of the problem-solving methods. </p>

	<br><H2> System Requirements </H2>

	<p> Green Light District (GLD) runs on Linux, Unix and Windows with JDK 2 1.3.
	GLD installation requires 2 MB of hard drive space, and about 10 MB for an infrastructure
	consisting of about 50 nodes (see <a href="definitions.html">definitions</a>), roads having 4 lanes, and 300 road users at a time.
	For the above infrastructure, approximately the following system is required:
